 - Requires constant involvement, less suited for fixed-scope projects.
Waterfall
 Advantages
- Structured, well-documented, ideal for predictable projects
 Disadvantages
 - Less flexible, difficult to adapt to changes.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile: Best for projects requiring frequent updates, like web applications or SaaS platforms.
Waterfall: Suitable for projects with fixed requirements, such as government software systems or regulated environments.
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
